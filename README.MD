## Microservices

Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together.

The top 3 reasons for using microservices are:

1. `Zero-downtime independent deployability`. If we have multiple small micoservices that each have a seperate functionality, we can easily just **update only this individual microservice** rather that **the whole application**. This **reduces the dowtime, or eliminates the downtime** of the application, because only the specific microservice needs to be redeployed.


2. `Isolation of data and of processing around that data`. Each microservice manages its own data and business logic. There is no shared database; each service owns its data and is responsible for its consistency and behavior. 
   - So we have **increased security** as data is used only where is needed
   - We **avoid tight coupling** because there is no dependencies between the services
   - We **can scale up** easily because we don't need to redeploy the whole application

3. `Use microservices to reflect the organizational structure`. Basically it can help an organisation to **maintain** and **structure** different apps, because it can assign teams to handle different microservices. When the **Organisation scales**, it is easy to assign and distribute workload on new members by assigning them new or existing microservice.
